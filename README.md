## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the solutions to the Transportation Problem. Specifically, we implemented the North-west corner method, Vogel's approximation method, Russell's approximation method and the implementation only solves for the initial basic feasible solution

## Features

- Solves Transportation Problem.
- Provides initial basic feasible solution via the North-west corner method, Vogel's approximation method and Russell's approximation method.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   https://github.com/Isistickz/interior_point
   ```
2. Install the dependency
```bash
pip install numpy
```
3. cd into the folder and run the main.py
```bash
cd interior_point
python main.py
```
4. Follow the prompts of the program to enter the inputs. We make two fundamental assumptions about the LPPs you want to solve:
   - That they are in standard form already, i.e. all slack variables have been added already, where necessary
   - That they are maximization problems.
