## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the solutions to the Transportation Problem. Specifically, we implemented the North-west corner method, Vogel's approximation method, Russell's approximation method and the implementation only solves for the initial basic feasible solution

## Features

- Solves Transportation Problem.
- Provides initial basic feasible solution via the North-west corner method, Vogel's approximation method and Russell's approximation method.
